<h1>The Best Movies According to Sonali</h1>

<h2>My favorite top 3 movies all the time</h2>
<hr/>

<H3>Om Shanti Om</H3>
<p>This is a movie of rebirth which makes it phenominal. The hero is my most favorite Shah Rukh Khan. 
It shows the heartbroken past of the hero and after rebirth how he takes revenge to the person who 
planned the death of him and his love.</p>

<H3>Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi</H3>
<p>Once again this movie is of my favorite Shah Rukh Khan. Here the female lead was Anushka Sharma and 
this movie was her debut. The story was such a masterpiece how a broken heart can be healed by a person
who loves you without getting it back from you.</p>

<H3>Chennai Express</H3>
<P>This one is a comedy movie with a long journey by Chennai Express and also having love story. When
the hero meets the heroine, he was not aware of her background and the story goes on with a lot of
twists and turns. The movie is a full package of entertainment.</P>
